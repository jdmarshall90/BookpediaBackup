# BookpediaBackup
An AppleScript to automatically make a backup of your Bookpedia library: https://www.bruji.com/bookpedia/. 
The backup is stored in your home folder, in a "Bookpedia_automated_backups" directory.

I have not tested with the other *pedia products, but it might work with those as well. If not, open a ticket and/or submit a pull request.
